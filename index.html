                        <p>I am currently a freshman in UCLA with a large interest in data science.  I primarily have used Python for data analysis and scraping, although I am looking to expand beyond this limitation. I've also dabbled with other areas of programming, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development, a little bit of Php for backend, and I've learned Java and C++ in my classes.</p>
                        <p>Outside of programming, my interests lie in reading books, dreaming up startup ideas, writing short stories, and playing tennis.</p>

					<h3 class = "text-uppercase">Socos</h3>
					<p>I interned at a company called Socos during the summer of 2016.  During this time, I created several scraping scripts to extract data off of websites, organize the data for analysis, and also applied some basic machine learning tactics to find patterns in the data.</p>

					<p>This is a Javascript game I developed in collaboration with others at UCLA while I was learning Javascript (credit to UCLA ACM-Hack).  This is my first foray into making web applications.  Although developed with others, on my own I added different styles to the previous barebones (pun intended) hangman layout, as well as adding functionalities such as being able to guess the word, different categories, and more words.

					<p>As a personal project and out of my curiosity to experience what working with machine learning and data science really felt like, I further explored Python's scikit-learn library, playing with their test datasets and seeing what I could accomplish on my own.  Included in the github are all the scripts I wrote.</p>

                    <p>Created at a UCLA beginner hackathon called Hack on the Hill, this app allows you to put in your favorite foods from the UCLA dining menu and be notified if the meal is present on today's menu.  Every day at midnight, the app scrapes the menu to update it's information.  I worked mostly on the front end of the app, learning how to display the information corrently with Android elements.</p>

BruinUnits aims to take out the uncertainty of process by calculating the chance of enrolling in a certain class based off of one's enrollment time.</p>
