Hi! I'm Terrence.  I'm currently a second-year CS major at UCLA.  My main
interests are a combination of backend/server development, general machine
learning, tennis, and debating politics.

## Internships
In the summer of 2016, I had to privilege to work at
[Socos](https://www.socoslearning.com/){:target="_blank"} as a data analyst intern, working on
compiling and cleaning datasets. I'm really grateful to [Vivienne Ming](http://www.vivienneming.com/){:target="_blank"}
for being such a great mentor and teaching me everything from startup knowledge
to machine learning.

In the summer of 2017, I interned at
[PennyMac](https://www.pennymacusa.com/careers){:target="_blank"}, developing machine learning
models to predict the likelihood of mortage payoffs in the long term. I was
lucky to work under the guidance of [Ben
Zamehzedah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-zamanzadeh-6681461/){:target="_blank"}, 
who checked my models weren't predicting the wrong things (it happened several times) and
helped me think like a data engineer.
