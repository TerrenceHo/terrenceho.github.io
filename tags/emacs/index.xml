      <title>Writing My Blog Posts with Org</title>

      <description>Hugo is an awesome blog generator. However, it&amp;rsquo;s primary content mode is Markdown, and writing in org-mode feels much better than writing in Markdown. org-mode can automatically convert to Markdown, but then I have to edit the generated Markdown file to add YAML front-matter that Hugo consumes, which is annoying.
Enter ox-hugo. It allows you to maintain and generate Hugo-compatible Markdown in org-mode, and automatically generates the necessary metadata Hugo requires.</description>

      <title>How I Started Using Emacs</title>

      <description>This is how I started using GNU Emacs with no prior experience. This is intended to help those who want to start using Emacs as well. I&amp;rsquo;ll start from a base setup, show you where I looked around for help, show you how I found myself using my current configuration. While this post goes through the steps to get started with Emacs, I definitely omitted the steps that didn&amp;rsquo;t help or the parts where I floundered around not knowing what I was doing.</description>
