      <description>Go has a really nice testing suite built into its compiler tool chains. It&#39;s as simple as running go test in your package, and all files marked *_tests.go will be executed. We can also run benchmarks during testing, by adding the -bench flag to the go test command. I never really benchmarked anything before, so I decided to explore Go&#39;s benchmarking utilities, and flex some of my algorithm skills in the process.</description>
